      The list below your NetID displays all the jobs that you are associated with:<br>
      1) You are added as an employee by your employer<br>
      2) You are added as an employer by a fellow employer<br>
      3) You have created a new employment as an employer<br>
        <br>
      For each employment, a calendar will be displayed containing the available shifts outlined by the employers.<br>
        <br>
      <b>Enroll in shift:</b> Click on a shift of your desire, and select <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span></button><br>
      <b>Drop shift:</b> Click on one of your shift and select <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span></button><br>
      <b>Request swap:</b> Click on your shift and select <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-random" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>. Choose all shifts that you would like to swap with.<br>
      <b>Request sub:</b> Click on your shift and select <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-resize-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>. The request would then be broadcasted to all fellow employees.<br>

        <br>
      If your request for a swap or sub is accepted, this will be notified to you.

        <br>
        <br>

      <b>Filtering Option:</b> <br>
      Employees would be able to specify the date and time for which they would consider a request for a swap or sub. Any requests that do not match this requirement would not be notified to the employee. <br>
      To do so, select <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter" aria-hidden="true"></span></button> above the appropriate calendar and select all shifts that you would consider.<br>
        <br>

      <b>For Employers Only:</b> <br>
      Along with the calendar, you will be able to add and remove employees through the interactive list on the right. Selecting on a specific employee will display<br>
      his/her weekly work hours below. You will receive all notifications of enrollments, drops, and successful swaps or subs.<br>
